Can we make dashcam footage actaully usable?!

I am sure I have to convince no one that dashcam footage is not as reliable in identifying license plates in adverse lighting condition as we would hope. In a time where phone cameras are life-like dashcams footage is still stuck in the stone ages.

Can we improve these puny little cameras to actually give us full peace of mind as we drive down the road or leave our cars parked while we go off and do other things?

-First, we will develope improvements through AI image enhancement (and add a license plate classification algo if all goes well).

-Second, if available, we will try better hardware.
